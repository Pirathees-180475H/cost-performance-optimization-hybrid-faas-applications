# Cost-Performance-Optimization-Of-Hybrid Cloud-FAAS-Applications
Final year project developed to find sweet spot hybrid cloud configurations for serverless FaaS applications

Cloud users are facing the practical problem of finding the tradeoff between the  limitation of budget and the expected performance of serverless applications. Since the significant factors are cost and performance.The challenge is to find the sweet spot, the tradeoff between these two factors. By deciding which jobs will run on public clouds and which are running through the private clouds, we can lead to the sweet spot. This sweet spot will define the tradeoff between the cost and performance of executing a FaaS application in a hybrid cloud environment.

There are no such tools for suggestions to select the cloud platforms to deploy their functions over the hybrid cloud concept according to the tradeoff of these factors. Users need a platform that can give better suggestions for distributing the work over a hybrid cloud infrastructure according to their demands (an application with constraints) with tradeoffs between these two factors (cost and performance). With these suggestions, cloud users can configure their FaaS application to optimize the cost with their constraints.
